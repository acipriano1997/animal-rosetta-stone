# Animal Rosetta Stone

Animal Rosetta Stone (ARS) is an open, evidence-grounded research project for studying animal communication without assuming that signals map cleanly to human-language translations.

This repository is the **canonical executable authority** for ARS code, tests, CI, executable fixtures, runtime manifests, and exact-head verification evidence. Google Drive remains the human-readable semantic authority for scientific method, research questions, preregistrations, evidence governance, claim ceilings, schedules, and accepted project documentation.

## Current executable scope

The first executable slice is the chimpanzee receiver-corpus harness and hardened `PR0006` receiver-modality reanalysis path. It includes:

- fail-closed rights, provenance, schema, missingness, split, grouping, leakage, nuisance, and sanity gates;
- `RHF-001..035` synthetic/adversarial fixture execution;
- `HA-001..016` structural artifact-bundle generation for synthetic verification;
- five-fold dyad-grouped PR0006 validation with training-fold-only preprocessing;
- paired out-of-fold delta log loss, grouped bootstrap uncertainty, leave-signaller-out robustness, and deterministic modality-permutation sanity testing;
- explicit `ZERO_SYNTHETIC` separation: synthetic fixtures and verification outputs carry **no biological evidentiary weight**.

## Rosetta Research Workbench — Phase I

### Slice 1 — executable fixture surface

A deliberately barebones, read-only browser shell is implemented from a frozen chimpanzee RQ0001 view-model snapshot:

```bash
ars-workbench --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

The Slice 1 fallback displays species activation/gates, RQ0001 and competing hypotheses, D0018/D0020 corpus metadata, D0019/D0025 rights-gated metadata, RUN-001..006 state, segregated ZERO_SYNTHETIC software evidence, and navigable provenance pointers.

### Slice 2A — canonical-read adapter boundary

The Workbench can now consume a validated `WORKBENCH-CANONICAL-READ-v0.1` JSON bundle instead of the packaged fixture. Set:

```bash
export ARS_WORKBENCH_CANONICAL_SOURCE=/path/to/canonical-read-bundle.json
ars-workbench --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

The source may be a local path, a `file://` URI, or an HTTP(S) endpoint. File-backed bundles are current as-of exports and are **not** labeled live. HTTP(S) sources are labeled live canonical-read transports. `/api/authority-status` exposes the source mode, transport, authority state, and semantic-owner bindings.

The adapter fails closed if the authority state is stale/conflicted, required domain bindings are missing, provenance references do not resolve, a dataset attempts to acquire semantic authority, or ZERO_SYNTHETIC software verification is presented as biological evidence.

Slice 2A establishes the transport and validation boundary only. A direct Drive/ACEB synchronization/export service that produces the canonical bundle remains open Slice 2 work; the repository does not claim that direct Google Drive synchronization is complete.

## Canonical bindings

`contracts/canonical_bindings.json` pins the Drive document revision IDs and ACEB registry ranges consumed by executable research paths. `contracts/workbench_canonical_read_contract.json` defines the Workbench adapter envelope and its fail-closed transport semantics. If Drive semantic authority changes, code is stale until reconciled; code never silently redefines the scientific rules.

## Verification

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/run_rhf_suite.py --out build/rhf_suite_receipt.json
python scripts/run_synthetic_verification.py --out-dir build/synthetic_verification
python scripts/verify_workbench_slice1.py
python scripts/verify_workbench_slice2_adapter.py
```

GitHub Actions runs the same verification on pull requests and `main` and uploads exact-head receipts.

## Scientific boundary

Passing this software suite means only that the executable harness and Workbench adapter behave as frozen on their registered software inputs. It does **not** establish animal-signal meaning, compositionality, syntax, cross-species generalization, welfare safety, or CRG-C biological credit. Real empirical execution remains rights-, provenance-, preregistration-, and claim-ceiling gated.

No software license has been selected yet. Third-party rights and the intended open-source licensing boundary will be reviewed before a repository license is adopted.
